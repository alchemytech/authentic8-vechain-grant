### Overview

Our project is an innovative supply chain solution that leverages the power of blockchain technology to create a transparent, traceable, and secure system. Central to our project is the creation and management of phygital products - physical products with a digital identity. We plan to achieve this by integrating the functionalities of the VeChain Toolchain Console and the VeChain blockchain.

The VeChain Toolchain Console offers the capability to purchase NFC chips of varying sizes and shapes. These NFC chips are instrumental in creating a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. By linking these NFC chips to our physical products, we create a unique digital identity for each product, effectively making them phygital.

Our solution is designed to store and manage SKU creation, SKU binding with NFC tags, and track every ownership change for the tag, all on the VeChain blockchain. This empowers our users with a comprehensive history of each product, fostering trust and transparency in the supply chain.

We are deeply interested in the VeChain ecosystem due to its unique blend of blockchain technology and supply chain management tools. VeChain provides an efficient and robust platform for our solution, allowing us to create a product that serves our users and contributes to the growth and diversity of applications within the VeChain ecosystem.

The VeChain Toolchain API plays a critical role in our project. This powerful tool allows us to interact seamlessly with the VeChain blockchain, providing the necessary functionality to store transaction hashes and carry out our SKU management operations effectively.

In conclusion, our project aims to demonstrate how blockchain technology, specifically through the VeChain ecosystem and its Toolchain API and Console, can revolutionize supply chain management by creating phygital products. We believe our project will provide immense value to our end-users and contribute positively to the VeChain ecosystem as a whole.


### Project Details

Our project employs a modern and robust technology stack designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. Here's an outline of the technologies we use:

Backend:
Our backend is built on MySQL, offering reliable and efficient data management. We utilize Laravel for our API and admin console, offering a secure and intuitive interface for managing operations. Laravel's robust feature set makes it ideal for handling our complex backend needs.

Frontend:
For the front end, we're using Next.js to develop our SKU Explore Page. Next.js offers a powerful framework for building user-friendly and high-performance interfaces. It provides us with server-side rendering and generating static websites for projects based on React, which ultimately enhances the performance and user experience of our SKU Explore Page.

App:
Our mobile application is built using Flutter. This modern cross-platform framework enables us to create a visually appealing and highly functional mobile app. The app offers users easy access to SKU information and the ability to track ownership changes for tags on the go. Using Flutter allows us to maintain a single codebase for multiple platforms, ensuring consistency and efficiency in our development process.

This blend of powerful technologies allows us to deliver a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution that fully leverages the capabilities of the VeChain Toolchain API and Console, and the VeChain blockchain.


### Ecosystem Fit

- Use of VeChain Toolchain API and Console: Our project uniquely integrates the VeChain Toolchain API and Console. This allows us to leverage VeChain's robust and efficient platform to create and manage phygital products. While other solutions may also use blockchain technology, the utilization of VeChain's specific tools is a unique aspect of our project.

- Phygital Product Creation: Our solution is distinct in its approach to creating phygital products - physical products with a digital identity. By using NFC chips purchased through the VeChain Toolchain Console, we can create unique digital identities for each physical product in our system, a feature that may not be prevalent in other solutions.

- Tech Stack: Our choice of technology stack sets us apart. We utilize MySQL and Laravel for backend operations, Next.js for the front end, and Flutter for our mobile application. This blend of technologies allows us to offer a seamless and efficient user experience that is tailored to our unique needs.

- SKU Management: Our project places a significant emphasis on SKU management. From SKU creation to binding with NFC tags and tracking every ownership change, our solution provides a comprehensive history of each product, fostering trust and transparency in the supply chain.
